# PiFi-logger
Simple, bash "available networks" logger initially designed for Raspberry Pi

The script saves available networks to given path as a list, using **iw dev wlan0 scan | grep SSID**

The program is free to use both personally and commercially. You can use and modify it as you wish, without crediting anyone.

>It is my first application, so I will be happy to hear your opinions and advices :D
